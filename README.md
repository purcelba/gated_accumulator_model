Matlab code illustrating a neural computational model of visual decision making (Purcell et al, 2010).

# About

The repository contains Matab functions for modeling the processes by which the brain decides where and when to move the eyes.  Macaque monkeys were trained to view an array of visual stimuli on a computer monitor and received a juice reward for making an eye movement to the "target", for example, the red square among green squares (Fig 1).  The array was presented briefly in sequences of trials with the target at a new location each time.  While the monkeys performed the task, activity was recorded from neurons that signaled when the target was in a particular location by increasing their activity (the discharge rate of action potentials).

        <b>Figure 1.</b> Experiment illustration.  Monkeys shifted gaze to the location of the odd-ball stimulus (red square) for juice rewards.  Action potentials were recorded from neurons in the prefrontal cortex (upper right).  The rate of action potentials was greater when the target was at the neuron's preferred location (lower right, red line) compared to when it was elsewhere (lower right, green line).

The model proposes that this neural activity is read out by integrating action potentials over time to a threshold.  Model input is generated by randomly sampling responses from neurons that respond to different locations on the screen (Fig 2).  The  activity is temporally integrated and the first population to reach threshold determines where and when the eyes should move (Fig 3).  The model is validated by comparing the predicted distribution of response times and choice probabilities to those observed for four monkeys (Fig 4; 22,542 total choices).  Several parameters (e.g., threshold, integration time constant, competition between neural populations) were fitted to optimize the match to the monkeys behavior.  See Purcell et al. (2010) for more details about the data, model, and fitting procedure.

The repository contains a directory, Data, with all of the relevant neural and behavioral data from the experiment, along with Matlab functions to simulate the model.  The relevante files are the following:
    - simulateModel (wrapper funtion for generating model input, simulating the module, and plotting the results)
    - getModelInput (helper function for concatenating data across different  experimental sessions and monkeys)
    - getSDF (helper function for transforming sequences action potentials into spike rate by time, i.e., spike density function)
    - model (core model for temporal integration over time)

In practice, the core model functions were implemented in C and parameter optimization was performed on the high-performance computing cluster at the Vanderbilt Advanced Center for Computing for Research and Eduction ([ACCRE](http://www.accre.vanderbilt.edu/)).  Parameters were optimized using Nelder-Mead simplex and Genetic Algorithms implemented in Matlab.
