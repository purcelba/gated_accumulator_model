Matlab code illustrating a neural computational model of visual decision making (Purcell et al, 2010).

## About

The repository contains Matab functions for modeling the processes by which the brain decides where and when to move the eyes.  Macaque monkeys viewed an array of visual stimuli and made eye movements to the "target" stimulus (e.g., red square) for a juice reward (**Fig 1**).  The stimuli were presented briefly in sequences of trials with the target at a new location each time.  While the monkeys performed the task, activity was recorded from neurons that signaled when the target was in a particular location by increasing their activity (the discharge rate of action potentials).

    <sub><b>Figure 1.</b> Experiment illustration.  Monkeys looked at the odd-ball stimulus (red square) for juice rewards.  Action potentials (upper right monitor) were recorded from neurons in the prefrontal cortex .  The rate of action potentials (lower right monitor) was greater when the target was at the neuron's preferred location (red line) compared to when it was elsewhere (green line).</sub>

The model proposes that the brain decides where to look by integrating this neural activity over time to a threshold.  Model input is generated by randomly sampling activity from neurons that respond to maximally when the target is at different locations on the screen (**Fig 2**).  The  activity is temporally integrated and the first population to reach threshold determines where and when the eyes should move (**Fig 3**).  The model is validated by comparing the predicted distribution of response times and choice probabilities to those observed for four monkeys (**Fig 4**; 22,542 total choices).  Several parameters (e.g., threshold, integration time constant, competition between neural populations) were fitted to optimize the match to the monkeys behavior.  See [Purcell et al. (2010)](https://github.com/purcelba/purcelba.github.io/blob/master/docs/PurcellHeitzCohenSchallLoganPalmeri2010.pdf) for details about the data, model, and fitting procedure.

The repository contains a directory, Data, with all of the relevant neural and behavioral data from the experiment, along with Matlab functions to simulate the model.  The relevante files are the following:
- simulateModel (wrapper funtion for generating model input, simulating the module, and plotting the results)
- getModelInput (helper function for concatenating data across different  experimental sessions and monkeys)
- getSDF (helper function for transforming sequences action potentials into spike rate by time, i.e., spike density function)
- model (core model for temporal integration over time)

In practice, the core model functions were implemented in C and parameter optimization was performed on the high-performance computing cluster at the Vanderbilt Advanced Center for Computing for Research and Eduction ([ACCRE](http://www.accre.vanderbilt.edu/)).  Parameters were optimized using Nelder-Mead simplex and Genetic Algorithms implemented in Matlab.
